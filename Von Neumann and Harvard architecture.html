<h2 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;color:#e97451;">Introduction to the stored program concept</h2>
<p  style="text-align:justify;color:#9c7c38;">
John von Neumann first presented the concept in the late 1940s. He suggested that a programme be electronically stored in a memory device in binary-number format so that the computer may alter the instructions based on intermediate computing results.<br>

The stored program concept is a fundamental idea in computer science that refers to the organization of instructions and data within a computer's memory. It is a key principle behind the structure of modern computers and plays an important part in their ability to perform a wide range of tasks.
In a system,Â based on the stored program concept, both program instructions and data are stored in the computer's memory in a binary format. This means that the instructions that control the computer's operations are represented as binary code and are treated like any other data. This is in contrast with earlier computing models where the program and data were stored separately.<a href="https://teachcomputerscience.com/von-neumann-harvard-architecture/">Read more</a><br>The key components of the stored program concept include:</p>

        <p><strong>Memory:</strong> A unified memory system that stores both program instructions and data. This memory is accessible by the central processing unit (CPU), which can fetch and execute instructions from it.</p>

        <p><strong>Instructions as Data:</strong> Program instructions are stored in the same memory as data, and both are represented in binary form. This allows for flexibility, as the same memory locations can be used for both program instructions and data.</p>

        <p><strong>Sequential Execution:</strong> The CPU fetches instructions from memory one at a time and executes them sequentially. This sequential execution of instructions forms the basis for the logical flow of a computer program.</p>

        <p><strong>Control Flow:</strong> The program instructions include control flow instructions, such as branches and jumps, which enable the computer to make decisions and change the order of instruction execution based on conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>Stored Program Principle:</strong> The concept that a computer can be designed to be versatile and programmable by allowing the user to load different programs into memory. This provides a foundation for the development of a wide variety of applications without the need to modify the computer's hardware.</p>
