<h1 style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;color:#e97451;">Backing storage and its types</h1>



<h2 style="color:#9c7c38;">What is backing storage?</h2><br> 

<p style="text-align:justify;color:#9c7c38 ;">
Backing storage is the non-volatile, permanent storage that keeps data and programmes in a computer system running even when the power is switched off. It is sometimes referred to as secondary storage or auxiliary storage. Backing storage stores data for an extended period of time, in contrast to primary storage, which is volatile and loses its contents when the power is turned off, such as RAM (Random Access Memory).The main function of backing storage is to give users a way to store user files, operating system, and application data in addition to massive volumes of data. The reliability and integrity of data over time depend heavily on this kind of storage.<br>
Backing storage is essential to computer systems because it offers a dependable, long-term data storage option, guaranteeing that data is kept safe even when the computer is turned off or restarted. It is a crucial part of keeping the user data, apps, and operating system stored in a persistent and easily retrievable manner.<br></p><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/backing-storage.htm">Read more</a>
